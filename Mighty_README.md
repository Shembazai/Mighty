# Mighty – Linux Post-Installer & Debloater

**Mighty** is a lightweight, smart post-installation script for Linux. It helps users rapidly clean up their systems, remove bloatware, and install essential tools — all while detecting the desktop environment (GNOME, XFCE, LXQt, etc.) automatically.

> "Petit mais puissant." – Designed by Shemba for clean, efficient Linux setups.
